# coding-skills

[繁體中文](./README.zh-TW.md)

A [Claude Code plugin](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/plugins) for opinionated TypeScript, React, and Python development — spec-driven interface design, TDD workflows, SOLID principles, and structured code review.

## Install

```bash
# add as marketplace + install (recommended)
/plugin marketplace add bouob/coding-skills
/plugin install coding-skills

# or load directly during development
claude --plugin-dir ./coding-skills
```

Codex hosts can still read the same `skills/` directory when installed through a compatible skills/plugin bridge, but this package remains Claude-plugin-first and does not ship a separate Codex plugin manifest.

Skills: `/write`, `/fix`, `/review`, `/pr-review`, `/refactor`, `/diagnose`, `/spec`, `/decision`

## Skills

### Workflow Skills (manually invoked)

| Skill | Usage |
|-------|-------|
| `/write <feature>` | Implement a feature with TDD |
| `/fix <bug>` | Fix a bug (diagnose → Red → Green → Refactor) |
| `/review [--staged \| path]` | Review local changes (style, tests, architecture) |
| `/pr-review [PR URL \| owner/repo#n]` | Static risk review of a GitHub PR (security, breaking change, secret leak, …) — read-only |
| `/refactor [path \| module]` | Safe refactoring with smell analysis and TDD verification |
| `/diagnose <error>` | Diagnosis only — find root cause without code changes. Also loaded by `/fix`. |
| `/spec <feature>` | Define interface contract (Given/When/Then + TypeScript interface + invariants) |
| `/decision <A vs B>` | AI-era tech decision framework (4-dimension scoring + pre-mortem + exit plan) |

### Methodology Skills (loaded by workflow instructions)

These are not shown in the `/` menu. Workflow skills instruct Claude to load them at the appropriate step.

| Skill | When auto-loaded |
|-------|-----------------|
| `principles` | Designing features, architecture decisions, SOLID violations |
| `testing` | Implementing features, fixing bugs, changing behavior |
| `done` | End of any workflow that produces code changes |

### Which skills each command loads

| Command | `spec` | `principles` | `testing` | `diagnose` | `done` | `decision` |
|---------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `/write` | if Spec Gate¹ | always | always | — | always | — |
| `/fix` | — | if design problem | always | always | always | — |
| `/review` | — | always | always | — | — | — |
| `/refactor` | — | if SOLID violation | always | — | always | — |
| `/diagnose` | — | — | — | standalone | — | — |
| `/decision` | — | — | — | — | — | standalone |

> ¹ **Spec Gate** — three questions before writing code: (1) Is this a bug fix or internal change? (2) Does a TypeScript interface already exist? (3) Can you name 3+ boundary cases immediately? If all YES → skip spec, go straight to TDD. Any NO → load `spec` first.

## How It Works

**Two layers** — workflow skills provide step-by-step processes, methodology skills provide knowledge.

- **Workflow skills** use numbered steps with explicit confirmation gates — Claude won't write code until you approve the plan
- **Methodology skills** are loaded by workflow instructions at the appropriate step (e.g., `/fix` always loads `testing`, optionally loads `principles` if the root cause is structural)
- `disable-model-invocation: true` on workflow skills — no accidental auto-triggering
- `/pr-review` delegates **every** review dimension to this plugin's own five read-only specialist agents and runs them all in parallel by default, every time — no keyword needed, no diff-gating, no external toolkit. The main context only orchestrates and merges; nothing is reviewed inline. A host without subagent support degrades to a single inline pass over the same checklist.

## Review Agents

`/pr-review` ships five read-only specialist agents (in `agents/`). They are
auto-discovered — `/pr-review` delegates to all of them in parallel by default, and
you can also invoke any of them directly ("review the error handling in this diff").

| Agent | Dimension | What it catches |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| `correctness-reviewer` | Code + breaking change + comment/doc | Wrong conditions, off-by-one, missing guards, broken state transitions, compatibility breaks, code-contradicting comments/docs |
| `error-handling-reviewer` | Error handling | Silent failures, swallowed exceptions, unsafe fallbacks, wrong retry, unreturned error state |
| `type-design-reviewer` | Type design | Weak/unenforced invariants, representable illegal states, `any`, broken encapsulation (4-axis rubric) |
| `test-risk-reviewer` | Test risk | Behavior changed without a guarding test, wrong assertions, removed/weakened tests, brittle tests |
| `security-reviewer` | Security + secret leak | Injection, authz bypass, CORS/auth/trust-boundary gaps, real committed secrets |

Why these over a generic toolkit: every agent emits the **same severity schema**
as `/pr-review` (`Blocking → High → Medium → Low`, four-line findings) so results
merge with no translation; all are **read-only** (simplification lives in
`/refactor`); they take a **diff bundle** from the orchestrator (works for remote
GitHub PRs, not just local `git diff`); they stay **model-agnostic** (`inherit`);
and they carry **no project- or vendor-specific assumptions** — an absent
convention never produces a finding.

## Workflow

```
/write "add user auth"
  → Spec Gate (interface defined? boundary cases clear?)
      YES → plan → confirm → TDD cycles → /review
      NO  → /spec (interface + invariants) → TDD cycles → /review

/fix "login crash"      →  diagnose  →  confirm  →  Red/Green/Refactor  →  /review
/refactor src/auth/     →  smell analysis  →  confirm  →  incremental transforms  →  /review
/decision "Supabase vs Firebase"  →  assumption audit  →  4-dimension scoring  →  pre-mortem  →  recommendation
```
